# Ubuntu docker container running a tiny cloud-init systemd service

This image provides a simple way of faking a cloud-init `systemd` service. I've
developped that mainly for quickly validating shell scripts sent as `user-data`
to cloud-init services.

As this is running `systemd`, it can be used to develop/check systemd services
interactions and dependencies when hacking your deployment scripts (but it only
supports `Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial` packages as this is the base distro).


## How to use it

With this image, it is currently required to start the container using `privileged`
mode to make `systemd` work.

If you want to be able to properly shutdown the container with `docker stop`,
you will need to define a specific stop signal (`SIGRTMIN+3`).

The `user-data` shell script file must be mounted in `/var/lib/cloud/user-data`. To
inject environment variables, you'll need to map it to `/etc/cloud-init.env`.

This repository provides sample files to demonstrate that.

```bash
docker run \
	-it \
	--privileged \
	--stop-signal=SIGRTMIN+3 \
	--volume ${PWD}/sample.user-data:/var/lib/cloud/user-data:ro \
	--volume ${PWD}/sample.env:/etc/cloud-init.env:ro \
	lionelnicolas/tiny-cloud-init \
```


## Limits

This *only* support `user-data` shell scripts.

Other `cloud-init` services such as SSH public keys management, `apt` repositories
or packages installation, hostname configuration, or YAML-based cloud-init `user-data`
files are not supported.


## Build

In order to build this container image instead of using the one on the Docker Hub,
you can use the following command from the root directory of this repository:

```bash
docker build -t lionelnicolas/tiny-cloud-init .
```
